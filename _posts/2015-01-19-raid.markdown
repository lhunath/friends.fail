The pack set out for another round of bullying Draenor orcs.  Tonight, we made great progress in BRF normal and took out Oregorger.  It was our first honest attempt after a quick trial yesterday and it took a few attempts before we all had a good clue on what this mole rat was up to as he rolls around the place.  We took him down after 5 good attempts.

A short visit to Highmaul Heroic helped to gear us up a bit - we know these fights pretty well by now and it was mostly smooth sailing.

Cheers!

 - HM Normal: 6/7
 - HM Heroic: 3/7
 - BRF Normal: 4/10
