## Chapter 1

It was another cold night.  Too cold to go anywhere.  Jack sat beside the fire.
Ever since the day of this nearly fatal accident during a triple act with Hiro and Soni,
his life had taken a terrible turn for the worst.

Jack lost both his arms that night, but survived.
Jack had been the star midget of the show, but lost everything he held dear that night.
He had taken to drinking and spending his insurance payouts on escorts.  Tonight he asked for something special.
The escort service called it the "Power of Love" package.
Jack had no clue what it meant, but he definitely needed a little something special right about now.

"Soni, the fire," he mumbled.  "It's dying."

Soni was his former partner.  She had been the act's star clown.  She'd given up that life, though.
While the circomstances were unfortunate, Soni had never been able to forgive herself for what happened that night.
For now, she'd taken to dedicating her life to Jack's care.  It helped her cope with her guilt.

"Don't worry, Jack.  I'll take care of it."

## Chapter 2

Chuck hated this job.  He was a star.  This was demeaning.  But it's what payed the bills, and would have to do for now.

Tonight he was visiting one of the service's recent but very regular clients.  He could not mess this up.

The night was terribly cold, but it didn't bother Chuck
He walked up the dark driveway and stood in front of the large, solid wooden door.
He closed his eyes, zipped open the top of his jacket enough to reveal his dark bushy chest hair and rang the bell.

To his surprize, a clown opened the door.

## Chapter 3

"Damn you, and damn your contracts.  If you think I'll sign away my core business that easily, you've got another thing coming."

Hiro slammed the phone.  He had no more patience to deal with this.  He was done.
He'd given everything to the circus, and now it seemed like everything was falling apart.
First, there was the accident.  Then Soni decided she couldn't go on.  What was left was hardly a show worth watching.
He'd tried to up the ante with the dancing lions, but it just wasn't the same.

"Stop wallowing," he told himself.  He knew there was only one way out of this.  He needed Soni.
He needed to convince her to let go of the past and move on.

He grabbed his keys and made for the door.  It was a terrible night out, but he was going to do this now or never.
Top hat on, he ran for his vehicle.  It was way too cold out to be out and about with just a tuxedo,
but he simply couldn't stand winter coats.  His small frame made it look like the coat was swallowing him.

Little more than twenty minutes later, he arrived at Jack's mansion.  Oddly, it looked like he had visitors.
Hopefully, that meant he could get to Soni and talk sense without Jack around to muddy things up.

He rang twice, but there came no answer.

"Dang it, it's freezing!  Open up," he muttered.

Two minutes passed, still nothing.  Hiro didn't drive all this way for nothing.  He tried the door knob.  It was open!
The night was too harsh not to take the invitation.  Hiro quickly opened the door and jumped inside.  What a relief.

The house was dark and quiet.  Except, no.  There was a definite thudding.  Almost constant.
Hiro called out.  When there came no answer, he decided it was silly to just stand here.
He made for the room on the right which appeared to be the thudding's origin.
