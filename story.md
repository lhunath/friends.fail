## Chapter 1

It was another cold night.  Too cold to go anywhere.  Jack sat beside the fire and stared intently.
He let the bright reds and ethereal blues dance with their afterimages on his retina.

He loved the fire.  It was one of the few things that could truly take him away nowadays,
floating amoung the searing tints in a care-free world of color.

Ever since the day of his nearly fatal accident during a triple act with Hiro and Soni,
his life had taken a terrible turn for the worst.
The details were vague on what had gone wrong that day, but Jack couldn't shake the feeling that
Soni's bad timing that day, in particular when taking off on the flying trapeze, had seemed like
the catalyst.  He'd never said as much, but then, he'd never needed to.

Jack lost both his legs that night, but survived.

Jack had been the star midget of the show, but lost everything he held dear that night.
He had taken to drinking and spending his insurance payouts on escorts, in a desparate search for
an escape from his present condition.  Tonight he asked for something special.

The escort service called it the "Power of Love" package.
Jack had no clue what it meant, but he definitely needed a little something special right about now.

"The fire," he mumbled.  "It's dying, Soni."

Soni, his former partner, had been the act's star clown.  She'd given up that life, though.
While the circomstances were unfortunate, Soni had never been able to forgive herself for what
had happened that night.

For now, she'd taken to dedicating her life to Jack's care.  It helped her cope with her guilt
while she tried to figure things out.

"Don't worry, Jack.  I'll take care of it."

## Chapter 2

Chuck hated this job.  He was a star.  This was demeaning.  But it's what payed the bills, and would have to do for now.

He was visiting one of the service's recent but most regular clients tonight.  He could not mess this up.

The night was terribly cold.  It had dropped below long-john temperatures and was well on the way
to long-johns-for-your eyes weather.  It didn't bother Chuck.  His coat was furry and thick as leather,
so he needed little more than a long-sleeved checkered shirt to keep the snow off his skin.

He walked up the dark driveway and stood in front of the large, solid wooden door.
He closed his eyes, undid the top three buttons of his shirt, enough to reveal his dark bushy chest hair, and rang the bell.

To his surprize, a female clown opened the door.

## Chapter 3

"Damn you, and damn your contracts."

Hiro slammed the phone.  He had ran out of patience with these leeches.  He was done.

He'd given everything to the circus, and now it seemed like everything was falling apart.
First, there was the accident.  Then Soni decided she couldn't go on.  What was left was hardly a show worth watching.
He'd tried to up the ante with the dancing lions, but it just wasn't the same.

"Stop wallowing," he told himself.  He knew there was only one way out of this.  He needed Soni.
He didn't know how, but he had to convince her to let go of the past and move on.

In an instant, his mind was made up.  A moment of clarity and it seemed clear what he had to do.
He grabbed his keys and made for the door.  It was a terrible night out, but he was going to do this now or never.
Top hat on, he ran for his vehicle.  It was far too cold to be out and about with nothing but a tuxedo,
but he simply couldn't stand winter coats.  His small frame appeared to drown in them.

Little more than twenty minutes later, he arrived at Jack's mansion.  Oddly, it looked like he had visitors.
Hopefully, that meant he could get to Soni and finally talk sense without Jack around to muddy things up.

He rang twice, but there came no answer.

"Dang it, it's freezing!  Open up," he muttered.

Two minutes passed, still nothing.  Hiro didn't drive all this way for nothing, and if he stayed any longer
he wouldn't be leaving again.  He tried the door knob.  It was open!
The night was too harsh not to take the invitation.  Hiro quickly opened the door and lept inside.  What a relief.

The house was dark and quiet.  Except, no.  There was a definite thudding.  Almost constant.
Hiro called out.  When there came no answer, he decided it was silly to just stand here.
He made for the room on the right, the apparent origin of the thuds.

Wondering what could cause such definite, powerful yet dampened blows he turned the cold brass handle and stepped
into the orange haze that came pouring out as the heavy door slid open without a creek.
