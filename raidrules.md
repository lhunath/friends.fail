## Things you need to do!

### If you're planning to raid, some of the things you should be doing;

Make sure your gear has enchants and gems. 
 - Neck, Cloack, Weapon, Rings.
 - Even if you are planning to change your gear soon, use a cheaper enchant!
 - Same applies for gems!  Get them!  Use them!

Bring Potions for prepotting and survivability!
 - Prepotting:  Using a potions (intellect/agility/strength etc.) in the final seconds before a pull allows a 2 minute cooldown so you can use another potion during the boss fight!
 - Mana potions, armour potions, health potions!  
 
Bring and *use* Flasks!  The greater kind!
 - Either buys some (not very expensive) or send mats to Primrose and she will supply the flasks you need.

Keep vent clean during raids.
 - Joking around is fun!  Downing bosses is also fun!
 - Try to keep jokes to /s, /w, /p, /g.  Or on vent during trash, but don't get offended if you're told to quiet down ;)
 
Be on time!  Early even!
 - Starting on time is key to completing as much content as possible!  Try hard to be on time, 15 minutes before raid starts.
 - Have your head in the game.  We only raid twice a week (in theory) so it's nice to show up prepared to do ones best and have a good time.
 - Expect to be there for the full raid time.  Leaving to play another game etc. is unacceptable, and will likely result in less raid invites. 
 - Don't sign up if you don't want to raid.
 - Life happens.  We all have lives, and things do come up, sometimes you have to go afk or bow out.  It's fine.  Just remember to /w an officer or raidleader.
 
 
Don't moan about repairs!  We all have them!  Again, if you don't want to raid, don't sign up!
 
 
 
## Loot Rules!
 
 We will Do private loot on the first 8 kills of a boss, then switch to ML, to prevent people from continually getting pieces they can't use.
 
 For Master Loot;
 - Every one who needs for main spec will get a free roll on each boss.
   If you have had a piece from said boss, but multiple upgrades have dropped, you will only be able tho roll if no one else needs the other pieces for main spec *or* the others have already won a piece from said boss as well.
   example: 3 pieces of crit plate drop.  2 Holy Paladins need all for main spec.  Both roll on first piece, whoever does not win can grab the second piece and they both roll for third again.
   
   If no one needs for main spec, it will be rolled for offspecs.
   
   If no one needs for main or offspecs and it is boe, all may roll for auctionhouse/alts.
   
   If it is bop, if will be disenchanted for guild enchants.
   
   
-Pugs have same loot priority as guild members!
