We just got seriously motivated!

This is the kind of motivation that is inspiring, encouraging, full of awesome ideas and generally doesn't last much longer than an hour.

So we're giving it all we've got until then.  To start, here's a website.  You're welcome.  I'll even put an awesome first post on it which will be all the incentive I'll need to come back every so often to post news and updates for all you curious netizens.

OK, that's all I've got for now.  But that was pretty good while it lasted.  I'm sure I'll feel crazy ambitious again soon!
