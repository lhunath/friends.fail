Casual Serious Self-Deprecating Entertaining Raiding Guild
----------------------------------------------------------

Friends with Benefits is what is commonly known as a casual serious self-deprecating entertaining raiding guild.  The name is pretty self-explanatory, but essentially means that we're serious about making real progress through the content while being a pack of well-natured helpful friends with a healthy sense of self-parody.

Have Your !@#$% Together
------------------------

In the end, like all other RP'ers, we're all here to escape the horrors of real-world drama.  We have real ambitions and we're a tight community.  We help each other out where we can, for the benefit of the guild and each other.  In return, we expect that members do their individual best to give back and contribute assistance to others as well as to the guild's raid effort.  That means helping others get gear, doing what is needed to get your own gear sorted, knowing your class and your rotation better than your cell number and arriving at the raid on time, with the necessary consumables and sufficient knowledge about what your responsibility in it is.

Be Engaging, But Not During The Raid
------------------------------------

We're active members and we love engaging with each-other.  We talk to each other about all stuff, life-changing to mind-numbingly trivial.  The only taboo is underhanded or insulting remarks.

During the raid, however, everyone remains silent and alert.  The raid leader speaks and guides the effort.  Any other topics are discussed via in-game chat.  Any suggestions or objections are raised to the officers or raid leader via in-game whispers.  This helps keep the raid focussed and drama-free.
