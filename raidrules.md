So you want in on some of the raid action, eh?

## Things you need to do!

Raiding is fun, but only when people are responsible about preparation.  Nobody likes constant wipes because some people are messing up the run by being unprepared.  Also, nobody likes feeling guilty for wiping the raid by being unprepared.

- Gear is vital.  But so is maintaining it.
  - Enchant your neck, cloack, weapon and rings.
  - We know your gear will change.  We all replace our gear.  Enchant it anyway, use the cheaper enchants if you prefer.
  - Don't forget to gem your sockets!
<br><br>
- Stock potions.
  - A variety of potions is essential for survivability.
  - Yes, we have healers.  Their mana is not endless and they should focus on tanks.
  - The longer you can keep yourself in the fight, the better our chances!
  - Start pre-potting: use buffing potions right before combat so they don't count toward the limit of 1 potion per fight.
<br><br>
- Bring and *use* flasks!  The greater kind!
  - Flasks are a powerful and last longer.
  - Buy some (not very expensive) or send mats to Primrose and she will supply the flasks you need.
<br><br>
- Keep vent clean during raids.
  - Joking around is fun!  Downing bosses is also fun!
  - Try to keep jokes to <strong style="color: #FEFAFE" title="say chat">/s</strong>, <strong style="color: #FE78FF" title="whisper chat">/w</strong>, <strong style="color: #A7A4FF" title="party chat">/p</strong>, <strong style="color: #33FA30" title="guild chat">/g</strong>.
  - Chatter is generally tollerated during trash, but don't get offended if you're told to quiet down ;)
<br><br>
- Be on time!  *Early*, even!
  - Starting late means we get less done.
  - Starting late is boring and frustrating for those that *are* on time.
  - Bring your head.  We only raid twice a week (in theory) so show up prepared to do your best and have a good time.
  - Plan to be there for the whole raid.  If you sign up, you're expected to have cleared your schedule. Leaving early to play another game or watch a TV show is unacceptable, and will likely result in less raid invites.  We need your help!
  - Raiding requires a certain dedication.  Don't like dedicating yourself to a game?  Don't sign up!  You're still just as welcome a member!
  - Life happens.  We all have lives, and things do come up.  Sometimes you have to go AFK or bow out.  It's fine.  <strong style="color: #FE78FF" title="whisper" title="whisper chat">/w</strong> an officer or the raid leader.

- Expect repair bills!
  - Don't moan.  We all get the bill.
  - Don't want to spend the money?  Skip the raid.
 
## Loot Rules!
 
We will do <strong>private loot</strong> on the first 8 kills of a boss, then switch to <strong>master loot</strong>, to prevent people from continually getting pieces they can't use.
 
### Master Loot

- Every one who needs for main spec will get a free roll on each boss.
  - If you have had a piece from said boss, but multiple upgrades have dropped, you will only be able tho roll if no one else needs the other pieces for main spec *or* the others have already won a piece from said boss as well.
  - Example: 3 pieces of crit plate drop.  2 Holy Paladins need all for main spec.  Both roll on first piece, whoever does not win can grab the second piece and they both roll for third again.
- If no one needs for main spec, it will be rolled for offspecs.
- If no one needs for main or offspecs and it is boe, all may roll for auctionhouse/alts.
- If it is bop, if will be disenchanted for guild enchants.
- Pugs have same loot priority as guild members!
