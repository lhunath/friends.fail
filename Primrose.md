Undoubtedly the most paradoxally loveliest and scariest of paladins, Primrose is a marvel of ancient WoW lore.  Lend her your ear and she will tell you tales of the mysterious deeps of Old Ironforge, Druid swim-form trainers long forgotten and what our world was like before the Cataclysm's fires and Illidin's demons took hold.
